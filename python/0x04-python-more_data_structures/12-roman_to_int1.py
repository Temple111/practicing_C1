#1st explanation of code
''' This is a Python code that converts a Roman numeral string to an integer. The code loops through each character in the string and checks if the current character is greater than the previous character. If it is, it subtracts twice the value of the previous character from the current character. The result is then added to an integer variable called int_equ.

For example, if the input string is “XIV”, the code will first convert “X” to 10 and add it to int_equ. It will then move on to “I” and check if it is greater than “X”. Since it isn’t, it will simply add 1 to int_equ. Finally, it will move on to “V” and check if it is greater than “I”. Since it is, it will subtract twice the value of “I” (2) from “V” (5) and add the result (3) to int_equ. '''

#2nd explanation
''' The first line, #!/usr/bin/python3, is known as a shebang line and is used to specify the interpreter for running the script (in this case, Python 3).

The roman_to_int function takes a parameter roman_string, which represents the Roman numeral string that needs to be converted.

The function begins with a check to ensure that the input roman_string is a non-empty string. If it is not a string or is None, the function returns 0.

Next, a dictionary called roman_dict is created, which maps each Roman numeral character to its corresponding integer value. This dictionary will be used to perform the conversion.

An integer variable int_equ is initialized to 0. This variable will store the equivalent integer value of the Roman numeral string.

The function then iterates through each character of the roman_string using a for loop and the range function.

Inside the loop, there is an if-else condition to handle cases where a smaller Roman numeral appears before a larger one (e.g., "IV" represents 4). If the current character's value is greater than the previous character's value, the function subtracts twice the value of the previous character from the current character's value and adds the result to int_equ. This accounts for the subtraction rule in Roman numerals.

If the if condition is not satisfied, the function simply adds the value of the current character from the roman_dict to int_equ.

After iterating through all the characters in the roman_string, the function returns the final value of int_equ, which represents the integer equivalent of the Roman numeral string.

Overall, this code provides a simple implementation of the Roman numeral to integer conversion algorithm. '''
