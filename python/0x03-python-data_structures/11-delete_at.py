#1st explanation of code
''' This is a Python function that deletes an element from a list. The function takes two arguments: a list and an index. If the index is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the list, the function returns the original list. Otherwise, it deletes the element at the specified index using the del keyword and returns the modified list. '''

#2nd explanation f code
''' The function delete_at is defined with two parameters, my_list and idx, both of which have default values.

The code checks if the provided index idx is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of my_list. If either of these conditions is true, it means that the index is out of range or invalid.

If the index is out of range or invalid, the code executes the first return statement. The return statement simply returns the original my_list unchanged.

If the index is within the valid range, the code executes the else block.

In the else block, the del statement is used to remove the element at the specified index idx from the list my_list.

After deleting the element, the modified list is returned by the second return statement.

In summary, this code takes a list and an index as input and deletes the element at the specified index from the list. If the index is out of range or invalid, the function returns the original list unchanged. If the index is valid, the function returns the modified list after deleting the element. '''
