    return tuple(map(lambda i, j: i + j, tuple_a[:2], tuple_b[:2])) #In Python, the syntax [:2] is used to slice a sequence (string, list, tuple) and return the first two elements of that sequence. The colon is used to separate the start and end indices of the slice. If the start index is not specified, it defaults to 0. If the end index is not specified, it defaults to the length of the sequence. So [:2] means “from the beginning of the sequence up to (but not including) index 2”

#1st explanation of code
''' This is a Python code that prints a matrix of integers. The function print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]) takes in a matrix of integers as an argument. It then loops through each row in the matrix and prints out each integer in the row separated by a space. If it is the last integer in the row, it prints it without a space. If it is not the last integer in the row, it prints it with a space. The function then prints out a new line after each row is printed. '''


#2nd explanation of code 
#---> This code defines a function called add_tuple that takes two tuples, tuple_a and tuple_b, as arguments. The function returns a new tuple that contains the sum of the first two elements of each input tuple.

''' Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

The function is defined with two parameters, tuple_a and tuple_b, both of which have default values of empty tuples ().

The first if statement checks the length of tuple_a using the len() function. If the length is less than 2 (i.e., the tuple has fewer than 2 elements), it enters the if block.

Inside the if block, the code appends (0,) * (2 - len(tuple_a)) to tuple_a. Here, (0,) represents a tuple with a single element of 0, and (2 - len(tuple_a)) calculates the number of additional (0,) tuples needed to make tuple_a have a length of 2.

The same logic applies to tuple_b. If tuple_b has fewer than 2 elements, it is padded with (0,) tuples to make its length 2.

Finally, the code uses the map() function along with a lambda function to add the corresponding elements of tuple_a and tuple_b. The lambda function takes two arguments, i and j, and returns their sum.

The map() function applies the lambda function to pairs of elements from tuple_a and tuple_b, taken only from the first two elements of each tuple (tuple_a[:2] and tuple_b[:2]).

The map() function returns an iterable, which is then converted to a tuple using the tuple() function.

The resulting tuple, containing the sum of the first two elements of tuple_a and tuple_b, is then returned by the function.

In summary, this code takes two input tuples, ensures that they have at least two elements by padding them with zeros if necessary, and then returns a tuple that contains the sum of the first two elements from each input tuple.'''
